## The snake-royale player container: a policy is just a prompt.
##
## This process is DELIBERATELY thin. It connects to its seat, sends ONE chat
## message carrying its registration, and then only receives. Every decision
## happens inside the GAME server, because that is the only container the
## platform injects the `anthropic_api_key` coworld secret into.
##
##   PLAYER_PROMPT        a strategy in plain English -> this seat is an LLM seat
##   PLAYER_SCRIPTED      coil | forager               -> this seat is scripted
##   PLAYER_POLICY_LABEL  a free label for the replay's `register` record
##
## A seat that sets neither is `coil`. To field your own policy, reuse this
## image and set PLAYER_PROMPT:
##
##   coworld upload-policy <snake-royale-image> --name my-snake \
##     --run /bin/snake-royale-player --secret-env PLAYER_PROMPT="<strategy>"
